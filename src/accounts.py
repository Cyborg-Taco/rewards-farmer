Rewards is per Microsoft account, and the browser profile is what holds the
sign-in, so an account here is just a profile directory. One directory per
account keeps their cookies apart, which is the whole requirement.

Unset, the run uses the single profile in constants.py exactly as before, so
nothing about an existing setup changes.
