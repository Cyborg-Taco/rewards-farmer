"""Search queries from public feeds instead of a language model.

The LLM in this project has one job: produce short strings to type into Bing.
That is worth an Ollama account and a model download if you want it, but it is
not the only way to get a search query, and it is the piece that stops someone
running the bot in five minutes.

Three keyless sources, all stdlib, no new dependencies:

  Google Trends RSS   real queries people are typing right now
  Wikipedia most-read topic seeds, useful when trends is unavailable
  Bing autosuggest    expands a seed into related queries

Autosuggest is what makes the chaining work. Asking Bing what follows a term
gives queries Bing itself expects, which is closer to what the LLM prompt was
reaching for than a model guessing in the dark.

Every source degrades rather than raises. A search that does not happen costs
points; a run that dies costs the rest of the day's points too.
